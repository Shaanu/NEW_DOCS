HOLA AMIGOS,
As some of you already know, today is my last day with HSBC. I am leaving the firm to pursue my interest in the crazy world of travelling and ofcourse technology. I want to EXPLORE myself and the world out there which is my ultimate aim. 
First of all, I want to thank each & every one of you for tolerating me. And Secondly, I want to thank myself for tolerating you guys ;)  JUST KIDDING ?

I’ve learned so much during my three years span here at HSBC. I’ve grown both personally and professionally, and I attribute much of my growth to the amazing people that I’ve worked with and the awesome opportunities that had been provided to me( Ofcourse, I’m kidding or am I not ? ). Okay, let’s move on….I don’t want to start blabbering about myself. Also, I thought that instead of sending out the usual obligatory “It’s been great…” email, I’d share with you a few life lessons I’ve learned from all of you during my time with HSBC. 
 
1. If you want to get rich, create multiple streams of income. This is rule number two in building wealth (Rule #1: Save, save, save). 
2. Your ability to network effectively is the most critical determinant of success in your career. Try to build a relationship with everyone you meet, and even more importantly maintain these relationships throughout your career. Indeed, authentic relationships are the only things that truly matter in life.
3. “Don’t treat others the way you want to be treated… treat others the way they want to be treated. There is a difference.” – Marc Schweitzer, a man who leads by example and taught me how to change my approach by always delivering his message with a smile and healthy dose of respect !
4. Don’t ever lose sight of your dreams. It’s so easy to get caught up in the grind and, let’s admit it, the crazy “world of HSBC” that we lose sight of the real world surrounding us. If you have a dream, get out there and get it done. Live the dream !
5. And Finally: If you’re a dude, the only part of the wedding you need to worry about is the bar. Make sure it’s open. And you better have  scotch, beer, vodka, tequila and suggestions are welcome ;)

As Eminem would put it, this is the spirit of this farewell:

“I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for IBD pricks
I put lives at risk when I write like this
I put guys at risk with a rhyme like this”

...BE HAPPY...KEEP EVERYBODY AROUND YOU HAPPY…KEEP SMILING...EVERYONE...EVERYTIME...EVERYWHERE...NO MATTER WHAT... DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAM...
BE DECISIVE...LISTEN MORE…SPEAK LESS...ACT MORE… LOVE YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS...ENJOY YOUR LIFE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN...WE GET ONLY ONE LIFE...MAKE A DIFFERENCE... SHOW THE WORLD YOU’RE ALIVE… HELP SOMEONE IN NEED WITHOUT A BLINK...TRAVEL… EXPLORE…FIND YOUR REAL SELF… ALWAYS KEEP THE CHILDISH THING INSIDE YOU ALIVE…
(YOU CAN ADD MORE)

Thank you all for being awesome. Feel free to call, IM, email, snail mail, or stop by for dinner anytime. I look forward to staying in touch and helping you succeed in your own individual quests for world domination.

Good luck, and I’ll talk to you soon!

Most sincerely,

	HI GUYS
	

DISCLAIMER: The below typed message is intended to offend everyone, so please do NOT presume that I have only singled you out for the honor !

As many of you are aware, today is my last day at work here. I'm sure some of you find it to be useful and some find it blissful, while some others find it painful enough to make me feel glad. I have always put my relationships with my colleagues before my relationship with my work, and would like to believe that I made a difference in most of your lives (and in some of your work). I am relieved to be relieved, and wish to take this opportunity to let you all know what a great and distinct pleasure it has been to type “today is my last day at work here.”
 
I would like to thank each of you for every experience shared, friendship made, and good times had during my stint here... as well as the occasional stab-in-the-back! It was rewarding to work alongside many of you, and to have known most of you personally. I wish you all the very best in the future, but only if you wish me the same! I am now looking forward to new challenges and only hope they are a notch above the ones faced here - which doesn't say much for this work.

Since the day I joined the company, every single time I've swiped the access card, I've reminded myself that today would come. Now that I’m leaving, I realize most things have remained the same - the cafeteria food still gives me a stomach ache, the a/c is still at full blast - making us feel as if the arctic wind is blowing down here, and the elevator still stops at every floor you don't want it to. But best of all, the signage in the building is amazing - tells us exactly where the stairs are in case of a fire.

To those few souls with whom I’ve actually interacted, here are my personalized notes of farewell (cast not in order of experience):

@Colleague 1: Hope to bump into you on some island someday - just make sure you're not wearing a 2-piece!

@ Colleague 2: The work is always going to be awful - get used to it... And remember, what happens @XXXX, stays at @XXXX. 

@ Colleague 3: Your pics are hot, your work is not - and don't let anyone fool u otherwise! Just kidding... keep the bandana on - it prevents people from knowing how much hair is missing!

@ Colleague 4: I have one word for u: "Dabanng!" Remember to keep a firm handshake.

@ Colleague 5: I hereby grant you full visitation rights to come and see me anytime you wish - the only condition being you have to get a chocolate every time... BTW - Nikon sucks!

@ Colleague 6: Your energy levels remind me of SRK… on sedatives!

@ Colleague 7: "Please sound horn" - people aren't usually aware you're coming up to hit them on the head from behind.

@ Colleague 8: I'm tempted to reprise the famous Zidane head-butt... but then I think why break my head over it?

@ Colleague 9: Kishore is king, so forget the Singh!

@ Colleague 10: I am NOT responsible for the CWG fiasco, the failure of Peepli Live, or what the Nizams did in their time (contrary to what the boss would have you believe).

@ Colleague 11: Arguing with you is like arguing with my dining table - its beautiful and polished, but made of glass... and everyone can just sit around it.

@ Colleague 12: You seem to have chronic 'bookitis' - please get yourself treated, and call me if you need to dispose of the cause...

@ Colleague 13: Your smile is your best asset - use it to good advantage. And don't forget - spell check, spell check, spell check!

@ Colleague 14: Follow this mantra for success - if at first you don't succeed, blame somebody :)

@ Colleague 15: Thank God you left before I did - It would've broken my heart to leave you here, and have you take over my 'space'!

@ Colleague 16: Smile - life is not an excel sheet...!

@ Colleague 17: I will miss your daily history lessons almost as much as you will miss walking down the aisle to deliver them...

@ Colleague 18: It's a small world, so beware - I could come back as your boss ;)

@ Colleague 19: Wish I had the chance to work with you more, madame... I have a feeling you'd be a great boss to irritate!

@ Colleague 20: I'll let you have my wireless music player, if you'll let me have your cabin - whatsay?

@ Colleague 21: Thanx for being the first guy ever to make me feel fat :) And don't forget to include me in your thank-you speech when you get an award!

@ Colleague 22: It's "Fly like a butterfly and sting like a bee," not vice versa... keep smiling, and don't let people's opinions affect you.

@ Colleague 23: Make up your mind, or make up the difference. BTW, I'm really Johnny Depp in disguise :)
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I'm not much of a speaker but I would like to take this opportunity to express myself today.
First of all, I would like to thank Sudeep for always supporting me during my tought times( he know what I mean)
Secondly, I would like to thanks Tej and Aparajit for being an amazing mentor. I really had the most great time working with you guys.
Thirdly, I would like to all those who I've worked with but still taught me in one way or other.
And last but not the least, I would like to give special thanks to Shivam, Nishu and Veepu for being there with me every time I needed. For helping me patiently with every silly mistake that I'd made.
And just a piece of advice to everyone, I know we're working professionals but we must forget to enjoy our life either.
...Words aren't enough for how good you all were to me
...BE HAPPY...KEEP SMILING...EVERYONE...EVERYWHERE...EVERYTIME...NO MATTER WHAT... => DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAM...BE DECISIVE...LISTEN MORE AND SPEAK LESS...SPEAK ONLY WHEN IT'S REQUIRED...LOVE YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS...ENJOY LIFE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN....ALWAYS KEEP THE CHILDISH THING ALIVE INSIDE YOU...
