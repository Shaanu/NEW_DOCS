CONTENT DEPLOYMENT:

Deployment FLOW ====> Workareas -> Different Workflow -> Approvals -> Staging => Edition => Deployment to specific Server

Sample Detailed WorkFlow ->

Weg Page Contains
 + Porltet -> Added to a Page ( Portlets are assigned CAM levels based on few factors) ( Page identifies the highest CAM Level present from all the portlets assigned on that page and it becomes page's aggregate CAM Level )
 + Skins -> Assigned to a Portlet
 + Theme -> Assigned to a Page
 + Layout -> Portlets are added into contains of different layout(i.e. One Column, Two Columns, Three Columns,  T Layout, L Layout, Reverse T Layout)
 + Security -> ID+V through CAM(Customer Authentication Model) CAMO(Lowest or Public level Access), CAM10, CAM20, CAM30, CAM40(Highest or High Risk Payment)
 + URLS -> Friendly URLs, Unique URL, Marketing URLs( Internal/External )


Editor -> Start Job -> Edit Content -> Send to Approver Group -> Approver Takes Ownership -> Review Content  -> Approve /Reject Content -> Move Content to Staging -> Edition  gets ownership -> Edition Create -> Deploy it to server

Workareas:
+ Customer Facing Application Workareas => MPP BDE Workarea(Customer) and MPP BDE pt Workareas(Customer branches one for each server). Likewise, MPP BDE PRE-PROD and MPP BDE PROD Workarea
+ Staff Facing Application Workareas => MPP BDE Workarea Staff(Customer) and MPP BDE pt STaff Workareas(Customer branches one for each server). Likewise, MPP BDE PRE-PROD Staff and MPP BDE PROD Staff Workarea

A - All GPL development is undertaken in the MPP BDE. When ready for a deployment, the files/pages are ‘ring fenced into a ‘set’. The set is sent to the PT workarea, edition created (in that area) and then deployed to the GPL SIT/AT environments.
B - Once the application is signed off in SIT/AT the set is approved, transferring the files/pages to the MPP staging area ready for an edition creation. This edition is then deployed to the GPL Certification environments.
C - Following the certification of the Release, a promote is undertaken to move the files/pages to the Production BDE. From there an edition is created and deployed to the Pre Production environments. Once the Regression testing has been undertaken a deployment to Production is actioned as detailed in the implementation plan.
